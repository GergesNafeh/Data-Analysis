#### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.  
- Standardized date formats (DD/MM/YYYY).  
- Fixed missing values (replaced nulls with appropriate values or removed rows when necessary).  
- Normalized call reason categories (e.g., ‚ÄúBilling Questions‚Äù vs ‚ÄúBilling Query‚Äù ‚Üí unified as ‚ÄúBilling Question‚Äù).  
- Split columns for better analysis (e.g., separating Call Center location into City/State).  
- Ensured numerical fields (AHT, NPS, SLA times) were in the correct format.  
- Created a **CleanedData_source** sheet to store processed data for pivot tables.
